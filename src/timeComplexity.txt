TIME COMPLEXITY OF COMPONENTS:
loadDictionary >> linear time (proportional to size of dictionary)
creating HashMap of dictionary >> linear time (proportional to size of dictionary)
editDistance >> Linear time (product of length of typed and given dictionary word)
longestSharedSubsequence >> Linear time (product of length of typed and given dictionary word)
runTest >> O(dict length * (O(editDistance) + O(longestSharedSubsequence))) = O(dictLength * 2(editDistance * LSS))
