As of right now I think I'll make 3 recursive methods, one for delete, one for swap, and one for add. I can then run them all on each other, with the base cases for all of them being hitting the threshold or finding a word in the dictionary. |
| March 6 | 7:45pm-8pm | I spent a bit of time trying to implement my recursive approach above and realized that it would be pretty complicated to use the 3 recursive methods while also making my approach time and especially space efficient. I then thought about using a tree or TST instead (like for the problem set where we had to check if it existed in a dictionary or not). I think that I'll have to spend more time thinking about my approach, as this is starting to seem like a much more conceptually intricate problem set. |
